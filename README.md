ccss-generator
==============

Every time assigning a new CSS3 rule I have to recall how many vendor prefixes was ever introduced to the property, was that a non-standard syntax and is there any alternatives for IE 5-8 browsers. So, I made this service, which just gives all additional CSS declaration to make the given W3C one cross-browser.

How does it work? You provide a CSS declaration (e.g. transition: inset 5px black;) and the services tries to make it cross-browser.

If you spot any inaccuracy or missing compatibility pattern, please feel free, to contact me.
